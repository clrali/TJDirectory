This project models a mock database for storing student/teacher information. The app has multiple pages which allow for teachers and students to be added to their respective directories, keep student grades updated, as well as plan events on a school calendar. The app was developed using Javascript and React, and it was styled using MUI. The database we used to store relevant information was through Firebase.
